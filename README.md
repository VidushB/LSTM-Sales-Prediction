# LSTM-Sales-Prediction

## Introduction
An LSTM based time series prediction project to get familiar with LSTMs predictions given a single feature.
This is my first solo machine learning project as I aim to learn to work with exploratory data analysis and RNN tools.
Performance was quantised using loss values (Mean Squared Error)

## Technologies
All code was run in a google colaboratory notebook.

Python version 3.6
Tensorflow version 2.4.0
Pandas version 1.1.15
Keras version 2.4.3

Running this code requires using google colab with your dataset stored in the linked google drive.

## Sources

The code is based on the following submission by [Karan Jakhar](https://www.kaggle.com/karanjakhar/simple-and-easy-aprroach-using-lstm)

The ["Predict Future Sales"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales) dataset hosted on Kaggle was used to train my model.
